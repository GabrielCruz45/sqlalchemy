    Session 1:
    Realized LLM exercises weren't helping with creating strong foundation (get rich quick schemey). Will do text tutorial, as painful as it may be. I can do it!

    Tetsting if can do git push to remote repo. All good, on to the tutorial

    The tutorial is showing legacy code, will sqitch to SQLAlchemy documentation. (https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/orm/quickstart.html)
